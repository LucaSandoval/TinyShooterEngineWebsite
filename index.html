</div>
<div class = "Description"> TinyShooter Engine is compiled to a python module (.pyd) for use making games with Python as a scripting language. To make a game in python with TinyShooter Engine, you simply import tinyshooterengine.pyd as a module. Both the demo game and the level editor were made this way! Game assets (scenes, sprites, prefabs) can be stored anywhere you'd like as long as their path is accurate in the python code. </div>
<div class = "Description"> The compiled engine module (tinyshooterengine.pyd) is already provided in the download, but if you would like to rebuild it from scratch, you can use the (Windows) build script with the following command: 'sh mingw64build.sh'</div>
<div class = "Description"> TinyShooter Engine runs on SDL3. You will likely need to modify the build script and change where it looks for the SDL libraries
and headers if you would like to do this.</div>
<div class = "Description"> To run the game as is, use the following command: 'python3 game.py ./Assets/scenes/scene_you_want_to_run.txt'</div>
<div class = "Description"> To run the level editor as is, use the following command: 'python3 leveleditor.py'</div>

    <div class = "Header"> Post Mortem </div>
    <div class = "Description"> "In the bustling city streets, amidst the cacophony of honking cars and bustling pedestrians, a sense of anticipation hung thick in the air. It was a day unlike any other, where the ordinary seemed to shimmer with a hint of the extraordinary. People hurried along the sidewalks, their faces adorned with expressions ranging from excitement to determination. Each step taken was a testament to their dreams, their aspirations, woven intricately into the fabric of the urban landscape. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of orange and pink across the skyline, the city came alive in a symphony of lights. From towering skyscrapers to quaint cafes tucked away in hidden alleyways, every corner held a story waiting to be discovered. And amidst it all, amidst the chaos and the beauty, life pulsed relentlessly, a vibrant heartbeat echoing through the streets of possibility.". </div>
