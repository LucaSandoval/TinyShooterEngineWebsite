</div>
<div class = "Description"> TinyShooter Engine is compiled to a python module (.pyd) for use making games with Python as a scripting language. To make a game in python with TinyShooter Engine, you simply import tinyshooterengine.pyd as a module. Both the demo game and the level editor were made this way! Game assets (scenes, sprites, prefabs) can be stored anywhere you'd like as long as their path is accurate in the python code. </div>
<div class = "Description"> The compiled engine module (tinyshooterengine.pyd) is already provided in the download, but if you would like to rebuild it from scratch, you can use the (Windows) build script with the following command: 'sh mingw64build.sh'</div>
<div class = "Description"> TinyShooter Engine runs on SDL3. You will likely need to modify the build script and change where it looks for the SDL libraries
and headers if you would like to do this.</div>
<div class = "Description"> To run the game as is, use the following command: 'python3 game.py ./Assets/scenes/scene_you_want_to_run.txt'</div>
<div class = "Description"> To run the level editor as is, use the following command: 'python3 leveleditor.py'</div>

    <div class = "Header"> Post Mortem </div>
<div class = "Description"> Overall I'm satisfied with the features of my engine and the small games it allowed me to build, but I do see a lot of room for both fundamental improvements to the engine as well as things I could have done beforehand that would have made the project experience less difficult. There were various setbacks along the way that ultimately led to me having to scrap a handful of features I wanted to include. Most of my issues were related to PyBind which I was using to wrap the C++ code. As it turned out, there was a lot of complexity and nuance to the handling of object lifetimes between C++ and Python that led to a lot of confusion. This is something I wish I had known going in and will be certain to pay much more careful attention to if I decided to do something similar in the future.
</div>
<div class = "Description"> In terms of next steps, I think there are many improvements that could be made to the core engine code and features it could support. The prefab and scene file types are simple and should be made more expandable as more components are added down the line. As of now you need to define custom code to interpret the different components you can add to your prefab, which should be made into a much more streamlined process going forward. I would love to add a lot of different components like animation, physics, particles etc... if I had several more weeks to work on this. 
</div>
<div class = "Description"> The natural end goal would be a full GUI for building games in TinyShooter Engine that would cut the need to write boilerplate code in python- similar in style to something like Unity which I roughly modeled the engine architecture off of.
